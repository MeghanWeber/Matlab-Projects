# Matlab-Projects

Was tasked with developing code that will perform the following functions:


1-Load the data from the text files. It may be useful to read the number of nodes (values) from the header of each text file. The header in each file has the same number oflines and the same organization.

2-Extract the unique locations from x-, y-, and z-dimensions in separate vectors for eachtext file.

3-Reformat the data (4th column of text file) from each text file into a 3-dimensional matrix.

4-Convert x, y, and z vectors from each text file into 3 dimensional arrays to be usedwith the MATLAB function isosurface. These matrices must be the same size as thedata matrix created in Step 3.

5-Plot all the data using the MATLAB function patch. The structural data should be displayed using a constant color while the current density data should be plotted using a red/yellow colormap. Adjust the lighting, material, etc. for the best visualization.
